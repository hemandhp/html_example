            <h2>Meet the Indian Software Engineer Who Quit His Job to Climb Mount Everest – But Not How You’d
                Imagine!</h2>
            <img src="travel.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="800" class="travel">
            <p class="t4">“If a 110 kg Gujarati guy, living a sedentary life, with no background in endurance training
                or
                mountain
                climbing, can transform his life and climb to the top of Mount Everest, nothing is impossible.” ~ Kuntal
                Joisher</p>
            <p class="t4">I first saw a photo of Kuntal back in 2017. There he stood, proud, buff and haggard, on Island
                Peak in the
                Everest region in Nepal, holding a Facebook-style plaque that caught my eye.</p>

            <img src="Island-peak-1-1536x1017.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="800" class="island2">
            <p class="t4">It was a photo of Kuntal, the first Indian to climb Everest on a vegan diet. I was blown away.
                I
                I had turned vegan just a couple of years before that, and was still fielding questions on where I get
                my
                protein and calcium from. And here was Kuntal, once your average Indian software engineer – standing
                atop
                the planet’s highest and one of its most formidable mountains. The first person to climb Everest on an
                entirely vegan diet.</p><br>
            <p class="t4">I finally met Kuntal at a cafe in Mumbai, as he delivered an awe-inspiring talk to an
                adventure-hungry,
                protein-curious audience. Despite his feat, Kuntal humbly confessed that he couldn’t be called the first
                vegan to climb Everest, because he wore a down jacket as he climbed, stuffed with duck feathers
                (sometimes
                plucked live off animals and often involving abuse; fallen and collected feathers are just not enough to
                supply the industry).</p>
            <p class="t4">So two years later, in 2019, Kuntal climbed Everest again – this time not only on a vegan
                diet,
                but also in
                cruelty-free gear. No down, no wool. His winter jacket was specially crafted by Save the Duck using
                synthetic and recycled plastic!</p>
