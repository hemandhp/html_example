            Rossi’s trademark #46 on both sides. Yellow accents in Sao Paulo Yellow highlight the kidney grille, alloy

        <h1 class="meet">Meet the Indian Software Engineer Who Quit His Job to Climb Mount Everest – But Not How You’d
            Imagine!</h1>
        <h5 class="t3">By hemand 12th January 2024</h5>

        <p class="t4">“If a 110 kg Gujarati guy, living a sedentary life, with no background in endurance training or
            mountain
            climbing, can transform his life and climb to the top of Mount Everest, nothing is impossible.” ~ Kuntal
            Joisher</p>
        <p class="t4">I first saw a photo of Kuntal back in 2017. There he stood, proud, buff and haggard, on Island
            Peak in the
            Everest region in Nepal, holding a Facebook-style plaque that caught my eye.</p>

        <img src="Island-peak-1-1536x1017.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" class="island2">
        <p class="t4">It was a photo of Kuntal, the first Indian to climb Everest on a vegan diet. I was blown away. I
            I had turned vegan just a couple of years before that, and was still fielding questions on where I get my
            protein and calcium from. And here was Kuntal, once your average Indian software engineer – standing atop
            the planet’s highest and one of its most formidable mountains. The first person to climb Everest on an
            entirely vegan diet.</p><br>
        <p class="t4">I finally met Kuntal at a cafe in Mumbai, as he delivered an awe-inspiring talk to an
            adventure-hungry,
            protein-curious audience. Despite his feat, Kuntal humbly confessed that he couldn’t be called the first
            vegan to climb Everest, because he wore a down jacket as he climbed, stuffed with duck feathers (sometimes
            plucked live off animals and often involving abuse; fallen and collected feathers are just not enough to
            supply the industry).</p>
        <p class="t4">So two years later, in 2019, Kuntal climbed Everest again – this time not only on a vegan diet,
            but also in
            cruelty-free gear. No down, no wool. His winter jacket was specially crafted by Save the Duck using
            synthetic and recycled plastic!</p>
